# Powershell Rename

This is a powershell script I wrote for my current internship that will get the serial number of the computer and then rename the computer to the serial number.

all that needs to be done to execute the script is run the bypass.bat as ADMIN and that will bypass the execution policy and run the powershell script no problem.

I had to make this because we do alot of re-imaging of computers and to help us keep track of warranties and whos computer is whos we rename the computer to the serial number and having the automated script makes that alot easier.
